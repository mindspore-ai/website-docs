# Release Notes

## MindSpore Golden Stick 0.4.0 Release Notes

### Major Features and Improvements

* Added post-training weight quantization W8A16 algorithm `RoundToNearest`, which realizes the lossless compression parameters of Llama2 7B/13B/70B and Baichuan2 13B networks by over 40%.

### API Change

* Added `PTQConfig` to configure the post-training quantization algorithm.
* Added `PTQMode` enumeration class, which can be configured in 'PTQConfig', is used to distinguish between the two phases of the quantization algorithm: the quantization phase and the deployment phase.
* Added `BackendTarget` enumeration class, which can be configured in `PTQConfig`, to indicate the backend to which the quantized network will eventually be deployed. For example, 'BackendTarget.Ascend' indicates that it will eventually be deployed to the Ascend backend of MindSpore.
