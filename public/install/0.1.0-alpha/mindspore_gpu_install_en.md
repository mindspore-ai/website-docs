## Environment Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Nvidia GPU

### System Requirements and Software Dependencies

| Version | Operating System | Executable File Installation Dependencies | Source Code Compilation and Installation Dependencies |
| ---- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MindSpore 0.1.0-alpha | Ubuntu 16.04 or later x86_64 | - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7.5 <br> - [CUDA 9.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-92-download-archive) / [CUDA 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base) <br> - [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) >= 7.6 <br> - [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build) 3.1.5 (optional, required for single-node/multi-GPU and multi-node/multi-GPU training) <br> - [NCCL](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-install-guide/index.html#debian) 2.4.8-1 (optional, required for single-node/multi-GPU and multi-node/multi-GPU training) <br> - For details about other dependency items, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r0.1/requirements.txt). | **Compilation dependencies:**<br> - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7.5 <br> - [wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/) >= 0.32.0 <br> - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.14.1 <br> - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) 7.3.0 <br> - [patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch/) >= 2.5 <br> - [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) >= 2.64 <br> - [Libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool) >= 2.4.6 <br> - [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake) >= 1.15.1 <br> - [CUDA 9.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-92-download-archive) / [CUDA 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base) <br> - [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) >= 7.6 <br> **Installation dependencies:**<br> same as the executable file installation dependencies. |

- When Ubuntu version is 18.04, GCC 7.3.0 can be installed by using apt command.
- When the network is connected, dependency items in the requirements.txt file are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. In other cases, you need to manually install dependency items.

### (Optional) Installing Conda

1. Download the Conda installation package from the following path:

   - [X86 Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [X86 Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. Create and activate the Python environment.

    ```bash
    conda create -n {your_env_name} python=3.7.5
    conda activate {your_env_name}
    ```

> Conda is a powerful Python environment management tool. It is recommended that a beginner read related information on the Internet first.

## Installation Guide

### Installing Using Executable Files

- Download the .whl package from the [MindSpore website](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en). It is recommended to perform SHA-256 integrity verification first and run the following command to install MindSpore:

    ```bash
    pip install mindspore-{version}-cp37-cp37m-linux_{arch}.whl
    ```

### Installing Using the Source Code

1. Download the source code from the code repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r0.1
    ```

2. Run the following command in the root directory of the source code to compile MindSpore:
    ```bash
	bash build.sh -e gpu -M on -z
    ```
    > - Before running the preceding command, ensure that the paths where the executable files cmake and patch store have been added to the environment variable PATH.
    > - In the build.sh script, the git clone command will be executed to obtain the code in the third-party dependency database. Ensure that the network settings of Git are correct.
    > - In the build.sh script, the default number of compilation threads is 8. If the compiler performance is poor, compilation errors may occur. You can add -j{Number of threads} in to script to reduce the number of threads. For example, `bash build.sh -e gpu -M on -z -j4`.

3. Run the following command to install MindSpore:

    ```bash
    chmod +x build/package/mindspore-{version}-cp37-cp37m-linux_{arch}.whl
    pip install build/package/mindspore-{version}-cp37-cp37m-linux_{arch}.whl
    ```

## Installation Verification

- After Installation, execute the following Python scriptï¼š
  
    ```bash
    import numpy as np
    from mindspore import Tensor
    from mindspore.ops import functional as F
    import mindspore.context as context

    context.set_context(device_target="GPU")
    x = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
    y = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
    print(F.tensor_add(x, y))
    ```
 
- The outputs should be same as:

    ```bash
    [[[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]],

     [[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]],

     [[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]]]
    ```

# Installing MindArmour

If you need to conduct AI model security research or enhance the security of the model in you applications, you can install MindArmour.

## Environment Requirements

### System Requirements and Software Dependencies

| Version | Operating System | Executable File Installation Dependencies | Source Code Compilation and Installation Dependencies |
| ---- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MindArmour 0.1.0-alpha | Ubuntu 16.04 or later x86_64 | - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7.5 <br> - MindSpore 0.1.0-alpha <br> - For details about other dependency items, see [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindarmour/blob/r0.1/setup.py). | Same as the executable file installation dependencies. |

- When the network is connected, dependency items in the setup.py file are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. In other cases, you need to manually install dependency items.

## Installation Guide

### Installing Using Executable Files

1. Download the .whl package from the [MindSpore website](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en). It is recommended to perform SHA-256 integrity verification first and run the following command to install MindArmour:

   ```bash
   pip install mindarmour-{version}-cp37-cp37m-linux_{arch}.whl
   ```

2. Run the following command. If no loading error message such as `No module named 'mindarmour'` is displayed, the installation is successful.

   ```bash
   python -c 'import mindarmour'
   ```

### Installing Using the Source Code

1. Download the source code from the code repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindarmour.git -b r0.1
   ```

2. Run the following command in the root directory of the source code to compile and install MindArmour:

   ```bash
   cd mindarmour
   python setup.py install
   ```


3. Run the following command. If no loading error message such as `No module named 'mindarmour'` is displayed, the installation is successful.

   ```bash
   python -c 'import mindarmour'
