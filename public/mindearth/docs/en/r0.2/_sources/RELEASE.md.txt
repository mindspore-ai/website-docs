## MindSpore Earth 0.2.0 Release Notes

### Major Feature and Improvements

#### Short-Term Precipitation Forecast

- [STABLE] [NowcastNet](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/nowcasting/Nowcastnet): A new short-term and imminent precipitation model based on physical constraints is added to support radar extrapolation precipitation forecast in the next 3 hours.

#### Medium-Range Global Predictions

- [STABLE] [GraphCast](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/medium-range/graphcast): Added support for 0.25Â° high-resolution data, GraphCast full-scale model training and inference.
- [STABLE] [FuXi](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/medium-range/fuxi): The weather model Fuxi is added to support the training and inference of medium-term forecast models.
- [STABLE] [Medium Precipitation](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/medium-range/graphcast): The medium-term precipitation module case is added to support medium-term precipitation forecast. The pre-trained medium-term large model needs to be used as the backbone.
- [RESEARCH] [CTEFNet](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/climate-prediction/ensoforecast): The El Nino prediction model based on CNN and transfer learning is added to extend the valid ENSO prediction period to 19 months.
