## Major Feature

- [STABLE] `High-frequency models library`: Built-in 60+ high-frequency models which ranks No.1 in the world in terms of coverage. High-frequency models cover from physics-informed (such as PINNs, DeepRitz and PFNN, etc.) and neural operators (such as FNO, DeepONet).
- [STABLE] `High-level API`: Developers and users with high-level APIs (for example AutoModel) allow an immediate deployment.
- [STABLE] `Basic API`: Provides basic APIs (such as Fourier neural operators, adaptive activation functions and high-order differentiation, etc.), which are convenient for users to build, train and inference neural network models of AI4SCI.
