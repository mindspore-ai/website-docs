It contains the industry-leading datasets, basic network structures, high-precision pre-trained models, and pre-and post-processing tools that accelerate application development of the scientific computing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expression</strong>: Python-based front-end expression and programming interface that supports two fusions (function/OOP programming paradigm fusion and AI+ numerical computation expression fusion) and two unifications (dynamic expression unification and single-computer distributed expression unification).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third-party front-end</strong>: support for third-party multilingual front-end expression, the future plans to successively provide C/C++, Huawei self-developed programming language front-end - Cangjie (currently still in the pre-research stage) and other third-party front-end docking work, and the introduction of more third-party ecology.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>: provides functions such as efficient data processing, common dataset loading and programming interfaces, and allows users to flexibly define processing registration and pipeline parallel optimization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compiler</strong>: The core compiler of the layer, which implements three major functions based on the unified device-cloud MindIR, including hardware-independent optimization (type derivation, automatic differentiation, and expression simplification), hardware-related optimization (automatic parallelism, memory optimization, graph kernel fusion, and pipeline execution), and optimization related to deployment and inference (quantification and pruning).</p></li>

</ul>
<section id="execution-process">
<h3>Execution Process<a class="headerlink" href="#execution-process" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>With an understanding of the overall architecture of MindSpore, we can look at the overall coordination relationship between the various modules, as shown in the figure:</p>
<p><img alt="MindSpore" src="https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/tutorials/source_en/beginner/images/introduction4.png" /></p>
<p>As an all-scenario AI framework, MindSpore supports different series of hardware in the device (mobile phone and IoT device), edge (base station and routing device), and cloud (server) scenarios, including Ascend series products and NVIDIA series products, Qualcomm Snapdragon in the ARM series, and Huawei Kirin chips.</p>
<p>The blue box on the left is the main MindSpore framework, which mainly provides the basic API functions related to the training and verification of neural networks, and also provides automatic differentiation and automatic parallelism by default.</p>
<p>Below the blue box is the MindSpore Data module, which can be used for data preprocessing, including data sampling, data iteration, data format conversion, and other data operations. Many debugging and tuning problems may occur during training. Therefore, the MindSpore Insight module visualizes debugging and tuning data such as the loss curve, operator execution status, and weight parameter variables, facilitating debugging and optimization during training.</p>
<p>The simplest scenario to ensure AI security is from the perspective of attack and defense. For example, attackers inject malicious data in the training phase to affect the inference capability of AI models. Therefore, MindSpore launches the MindSpore Armour module to provide an AI security mechanism for MindSpore.</p>
<p>The content above the blue box is closer to algorithm development users, including the AI algorithm model library ModelZoo, development toolkit MindSpore DevKit for different fields, and advanced extension library MindSpore Extend. MindSciences, a scientific computing kit in MindSpore Extend, is worth mentioning. MindSpore is the first to combine scientific computing with deep learning, combine numerical computing with deep learning, and support electromagnetic simulation and drug molecular simulation through deep learning.</p>
<p>After the neural network model is trained, you can export the model or load the model that has been trained in MindSpore Hub. Then MindIR provides a unified IR format for the device and cloud, which defines logical network structures and operator attributes through a unified IR, and decouples model files in MindIR format from hardware platforms to implement one-time training and multiple-time deployment. As shown in the figure, the model is exported to different modules through IR to perform inference.</p>
</section>
<section id="design-philosophy">
<h3>Design Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#design-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Supporting full-scenario collaboration</p>
<p>MindSpore is derived from industry-wide best practices. It provides unified model training, inference, and export APIs for data scientists and algorithm engineers. It supports flexible deployment in different scenarios such as the device, edge, and cloud, and promotes the prosperity of domains such as deep learning and scientific computing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provideing the Python programming paradigm to simplify AI programming</p>
<p>MindSpore provides a Python programming paradigm. Users can build complex neural network models using Python’s native control logic, making AI programming easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Providing a unified coding method for dynamic and static graphs</p>
<p>Currently, there are two execution modes of a mainstream deep learning framework: a static graph mode (GRAPH_MODE) and a dynamic graph mode (PYNATIVE_MODE). The GRAPH mode has high training performance but is difficult to debug. On the contrary, the PYNATIVE mode is easy to debug, but is difficult to execute efficiently.
MindSpore provides an encoding mode that unifies dynamic and static graphs, which greatly improves the compatibility between static and dynamic graphs. Instead of developing multiple sets of code, users can switch between the dynamic and static graph modes by changing only one line of code, which facilitates development and debugging, and improves performance experience.</p>
<p>For example, set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_context(mode=PYNATIVE_MODE)</span></code> to switch to the dynamic graph mode, or set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_context(mode=GRAPH_MODE)</span></code> to switch to the static graph mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using functional differentiable programming architecture and allowing users to focus on the mathematical native expression of model algorithms</p>
<p>Neural network models are usually trained based on gradient descent algorithms, but the manual derivation process is complicated and the results are prone to errors. The Automatic Differentiation mechanism based on Source Code Transformation (SCT) of MindSpore adopts a functional differentiable programming architecture, and provides a Python programming interface at the interface layer, including the expression of control flow. Users can focus on the mathematically native expression of the model algorithm without manual derivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unifying the coding method of single device and distributed training</p>
<p>As a scale of neural network models and datasets continuously increases, parallel distributed training becomes a common practice of neural network training. However, the strategy selection and compilation of parallel distributed training are very complex, which severely restricts training efficiency of a deep learning model and hinders development of deep learning. MindSpore unifies the coding methods of single device and distributed training. Developers do not need to write complex distributed strategies. They can implement distributed training by adding a small amount of code to the single device code, which improves the efficiency of neural network training, greatly reduces the threshold of AI development, and enables users to quickly implement model ideas.</p>
<p>For example, they can set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_auto_parallel_context(parallel_mode=ParallelMode.AUTO_PARALLEL)</span></code> to automatically establish a cost model, and select an optimal parallel mode for users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="api-level-structure">
<h3>API Level Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#api-level-structure" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>MindSpore provides users with three different levels of APIs to support AI application (algorithm/model) development, from high to low: High-Level Python API, Medium-Level Python API and Low-Level Python API. The High-Level API provides better encapsulation, the Low-Level API provides better flexibility, and the Mid-Level API combines flexibility and encapsulation to meet the needs of developers in different fields and levels.</p>
<p><img alt="MindSpore API" src="https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/tutorials/source_en/beginner/images/introduction3.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>High-Level Python API</p>
<p>High-level APIs are at the first layer. Based on the medium-level API, these advanced APIs include training and inference management, mixed precision training, and debugging and optimization, enabling users to control the execution process of the entire network and implement training, inference, and optimization of the neural network. For example, by utilizing the Model API, users can specify the neural network model to be trained as well as related training settings, train the neural network model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Medium-Level Python API</p>
<p>Medium-level APIs are at the second layer, which encapsulates low-cost APIs and provides such modules as the network layer, optimizer, and loss function. Users can flexibly build neural networks and control execution processes through the medium-level API to quickly implement model algorithm logic. For example, users can call the Cell API to build neural network models and computing logic, add the loss function and optimization methods to the neural network model by using the loss module and Optimizer API, and use the dataset module to process data for model training and derivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low-Level Python API</p>
<p>Low-level APIs are at the third layer, including tensor definition, basic operators, and automatic differential modules, enabling users to easily define tensors and perform derivative computation. For example, users can customize tensors by using the Tensor API, and use the grad API to calculate the derivative of the function at a specified position.</p>
